1. In the course materials, there is a section that introduces cloud infrastructure attacks, specifically related to AWS. I would like to confirm whether any of the exam targets (among the 3 standalone machines and the Active Directory set) are cloud-based targets (e.g., hosted on AWS), or if this cloud-related content is only for general knowledge and not part of the actual exam.

2. From what I’ve observed during the training, there is no mention of buffer overflow (BOF) exploitation — the content appears to focus primarily on web-based vulnerabilities. Could you please confirm whether BOF exploitation is within the scope of the OSCP exam?
